# IOT-Smart-Food-monitoring-using-TI-Sensor-Tag

- The objective of the project is to wirelessly measure the temperature and humidity readings of the food containers stored in a truck from the Ti sensor tag CC2650 using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

- Next the data collected is forwaded to IoT cloud using Raspberry Pi through WLAN communication.

- This project demonstrates how to configure Ti Sensor Tag CC2650, Install Bluez and gatttool in
Raspberry Pi, pair sensor tag with Raspberry Pi, retrieve the sensor data on to the Raspberry Pi in
the hexadecimal format.

- Then convert it to degree Celsius and integer for temperature and
humidity readings and finally use send the data to IoT cloud using WLAN.
